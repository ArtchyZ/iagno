  <title>Rules</title>

  <p>The object of the game is to flip as many of the opponent tiles while blocking your opponent from flipping your tiles. In order to flip a tile, you must first trap it between two of your tiles, horizontally, vertically or diagonally.</p>
  <steps>
    <item><p>
      The game begins with four pieces, two light and two dark, placed in the center of the board.
    </p></item>
    <item><p><em>Dark</em> goes first.</p></item>
    <item><p><em>Dark</em> places a tile on the board in such a way that it traps white tiles between two of the dark tiles.</p>
    <note><p>This placement can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal.
    </p></note>
    <p>
     When the dark tile is placed, the light tiles between the newly placed dark tile and another dark tile are flipped over and become part of the dark forces.
    </p>
    </item>
    <item><p>The players alternate turns until no more legal moves can be made by either player.  At this point the game is over. The end of the game often results in a full board.</p></item>
    <item><p>The winner is the the player with the most pieces of his color on the board.</p></item>
