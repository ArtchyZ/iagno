      Iagno is a computer version of the game Reversi, a two-player strategy
      board game. The game is played with tiles that are dark on one side and
      light on the other.
    </_p>
    <_p>
      The object of Iagno is to flip as many of your opponent's tiles to your
      color as possible while preventing your opponent from flipping your tiles
      to his color. This is done by trapping your opponent's tiles between two
      tiles of your own color.
